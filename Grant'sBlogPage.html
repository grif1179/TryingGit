			<h1>Dark Souls X Hinduism</h1>
			<p><span style="color:red;">/*Disclaimer*/ I am not a practicing Hindu or an expert on Hinduism. I simply took an Intro to World Religions class in college and found many of the ideas in Hinduism to be similar to the ones found in Dark Souls, so if I got anything wrong or have offended you please email me here: TheDorminatorZ@gmail.com so I can solve any potential problems. Also I am sorry if my thoughts are a bit jumbled. I am an engineering student so it has been a bit since I have written really anything like this. /*Disclaimer*/ </span></p> 
			<p>I do not know if it is just me who has noticed this, but the concepts in Dark Souls are very similar to concepts found in Hinduism. Since I do not know exactly where to start, I will just dive right into it. So here in the West when we think of Hinduism we normally think of re-incarnation, and when we think of re-incarnation we think of it in a positive sense. In the West we think of re-incarnation like a cycle of rebirth where we can right the wrongs of our previous lives. But in Hinduism re-incarnation aka samsara is a bad thing and is better described as a cycle of death and re-death and escaping this cycle of constant death is goal that Hindus are trying to attain. Which reader I bet you are already putting two and two together and see that samsara and the curse of the undead are very similar. </p> 
			<p>Another belief in Hinduism is the idea that everybody has an atman, that is your eternal self, and all of these atmans are actually part of a greater reality called Brahman. A good metaphor is that an atman is like a drop from an ocean which is Brahman. Now this might be a stretch, but I think that the first flame could be compared to Brahman and the life that came from it is atman. Now let me be clear, I do not think that the dark soul and the four lord souls are like atman because they are not all found in every enemy in the game. I think that the souls that you get from all enemies in the game after you kill them is more like atman because A) Every enemy in the game drops souls and B) the souls you gain you burn in the bonfire- assumedly returning it the first flame in from where it came which means you could make the assumption they are one in the same.</p> 
			<p>Also, another interesting similarity is that before karma was used as a short hand way of saying what goes around comes around, it was used by Hindus in the Vedic period to refer to fire sacrifice. And whether you look to all the things you sacrifice in the bonfire like souls and humanity or, for a more literal sacrifice, like Gywn/you giving himself up to link the flame, it is easy to find examples of fire sacrifice throughout the game.</p>
			<p>The final comparison I have is in the ending which I think is a good metaphor for the decision that anyone who believes in the Hindu doctrine must make. Do you give up the material world to end the endless cycle of re-death and return to Brahman, which is signified by the link of the first flame ending? Or do you embrace the material world and try to become as powerful as you possibly can, which is signified by the dark prince ending? </p> 
			<p>So am I just reaching for thin air here or do these connections seem as eerily similar to you as they do to me? Either way I would love to hear your thoughts on the matter.</p>
